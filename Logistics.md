We will cover flight expenses for the investigator and their invited lab member. You should purchase the lowest reasonably available airfare with a major commercial carrier. Lowest reasonably available airfare is the lowest coach or economy non-stop airfare for domestic flights and international flights in which scheduled flight duration is less than eight hours. We will reimburse you for your flights after the event. If you need reimbursement before then, [please let us know](mailto:natalie.caulk@moore.org).

### Expenses

Below is a description of what expenses will be covered and how. **Receipts required for all expenses over $75.**

**Airfare**: GBMF will pay for flights for both the investigator and their attending lab member. See _Flights_ section above.

**Hotel**: GBMF will cover all attendees' hotel rooms for the nights you declared on your registration form (minus incidentals). Please let us know if your plans have changed. Each attendee will have their own room. We will share confirmation numbers for hotel registration closer to the event.

**Food**: GBMF will be providing meals during the symposium, but the investigator will be responsible for other food costs (e.g., on travel days).

**Other Expenses**: The investigator is responsible for all other expenses, e.g., ground transportation, incidentals, baggage fees etc.

**Family care**: GBMF is pleased to offer family care support of up to $75 per day ($300 maximum) to attendees. The intention of these funds is to cover additional care for family members outside of regularly scheduled work hours and for the time required for travel to the workshop (e.g. evening or extended day care). You will not be required to provide receipts or otherwise substantiate the actual amount of costs that you incur. You should consult your tax advisor to determine the appropriate tax treatment of any payments received.
